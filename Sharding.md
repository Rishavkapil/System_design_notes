Database sharding is a process of storing a large database across multiple machines. 

A Single machine or database server can store and process only a limited amount of data. 

Database sharding overcomes this limitation by splitting data into smaller chunks, called shards, and storing them across several database servers. 


### Why database Sharding is important ?

As the application grows, the number of application users and the amount of  data it stores increase overtime. The database becomes a bottleneck if the data volume becomes too large and too many users attempt to use the application to read or save information simultaneously. The application slows down and affects customer experience. 
Database sharding is one of the methods to solve this problem because it enables parallel processing of smaller datasets across shards.
