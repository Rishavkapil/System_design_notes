A Service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle large units of work , such as when datasets grow. 

Another way to look at performance vs scalability : 

* If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user
* If you have a scalabilty problem, your system is fast for single user but slow under heavy load.
