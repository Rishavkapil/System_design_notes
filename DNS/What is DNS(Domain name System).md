A Domain Name System Translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an ip address. 

It is like the phonebook of the internet. 

Each device connected to the internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. 


### How does DNS work 

The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname(such as www.example.com) into a computer friendly ip address (such as 192.168.1.0) 
An Ip address is given to device on the internet and that address is necessary to find the appropriate internet device - like a street address used to find a particular home. 


When a user wants to load a webpage,  a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser
