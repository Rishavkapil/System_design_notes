## What is SQL 

SQL which stands for Structured Query Language, is a domain specific programming language, that is commonly used for inserting, updating, deleting data within databases. SQL is used to create and modify databases Schemas. 


## What is Structured Data ?

Structured Data is data that is organized in a Consistent, predefined format and often consist of alphanumeric characters, Examples include, financial transactions, inventory records, or customer lists which are often stored in SQL databases. 


## What are SQL databases ?

When the term "SQL database " is used, it refers to a type of database where SQL is the primary programming language used to create and manage that database. 

SQL application programming interface (APIs) contain group of functions that enable developers to execute and manage database operations without having to create individual SQL commands over and over. 


## Relational Databases 

Relational Databases , or relational Database management systems, store data within rows and columns which are used to form tables. A relationship between two tables can be created using foreign key. These foreign keys maintain predefined relationships that exist between the tables. 

It is important to note that relational databases are created and managed using a fixed schema. A fixed schema means that all data ingested into the database must be precisely aligned to predefined formatting standards which limits the type of data structures that relational databases can store. For example, relational databases are not able to process unstructured data but are excellent at supporting transactional or financial information that includes structured data or semi structured types of data. 


## NOSQL Databases (Not Only Structured Query Language)


#### What is NoSQL 

NoSQL is a database  management system approach used to ingest, store and retrieve unstructured data and semi structured data within a database. 


#### What is Unstructured Data ?

Unstructured data is data that doesn't have a predefined data model or consistent organization. In addition, unstructured data such as social media posts, can update and change rapidly while structured data, such as bank transactions, have a much lower rate of change. Examples of unstructured data include pictures, audio files , videos , maps etc.
