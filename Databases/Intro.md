Picking the right database for a system is an important decision, as it can have a significant impact on the performace, scalability and overall success of the system. Some of the key reasons why it's important to pick the right database include: 

* **Performance :** Different dbs have different performance characterstics, and choosing the wrong one can lead to poor performace and slow response times. 

* **Scalability :**  As the system grows and volume of data increases, the database needs to be able to scale accordingly. Some of the databases are better suited for handling large amounts of data than others. 

* **Data Modeling :** Different databases have different data modeling capabilities and choosing the right one can help to keep the data consistent and organized. 

* **Data Integrity :** Different databases have different capabilities for maintaining data integrity, such as enforcing constraints, and can have different levels of data and security. 

* **Support and Maintenance:**
