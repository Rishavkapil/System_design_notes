Normalization in DBMS represents the process of organizing data within the database in such a way that it minimizes redundancy. 

The process involves segmenting the database into two or more tables and highlighting relationships between them to eliminate redundancy and inconsistent data. 



### Why Normalization is important ?

* **Eliminating duplicate data**
* **Improving data integrity**
* **Simplifying database desing**



### Types of Normal Forms

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

The first normal form in DBMS requires that all columns in a database table contain  atomic (individual values). This means that data must not contain repeating groups or arrays. In simpler terms, each field must contain only one value, and each record must be unique. 


#### Second Normal Form
