A Load Balancer is a hardware or software device that keeps any one server from becoming overloaded. A Load Balancing Algorithm is a logic that a load balancer uses to distribute network traffic between servers. 



There are two primary approaches to load balancing. *Dynamic load balancing* uses algorithms that take into account current state of each server and distribute traffic accordingly. 

*Static Load Balancing* distributes traffic without making these adjustments.
Some static algorithms sends equal amount of traffic to each server in a group, either in a specified order or at random.
