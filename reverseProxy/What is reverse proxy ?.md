In networking and web traffic, a proxy is a device or server that acts on behalf of other devices. It sits between two entities and performs a service. 

Typically, a reverse proxy sits in front of web servers and forward client (eg. web browser ) request to those web servers. The requested resource are then returned to the client, appearing as if they originated from proxy server itself. 

## What is the difference between load balancer and reverse proxy ?

Reverse proxy and load balancers are both components in a client-server computing architecture. Both act as intermediaries in the communication between the clients and servers, performing functions that improve efficiency. 

A Load Balancer distributes incoming client request among a group of servers to ensure satisfactory speed and optmized functioning.

A reverse proxy , accepts a request from a client, forwards it to a server that can fulfill it, and return the server's response to the client.
