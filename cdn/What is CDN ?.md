A Content delivery Network is a globally distributed Network of proxy server, serving content from location closer to user. 

Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS, photos, and videos are served from the CDN. 

A CDN helps to speed up static components of your blog by distributing them across a number of servers around the world. 

This does two things -  one is to put much of your travel blog's content closer to the person who wants to view it. and secondly if content isn't being pulled directly from your server, it saves overall computing power. 


### What is pull and push CDN ?



#### Pull CDN 
Imagine a person loading your latest travel blog post. It probably has pictures in  it, as does your site's theme(eg. icons, background images etc. ) . For example, lets have your server in Australia.  You've just published your latest travel blog post and your biggest fan from another country wants to read it. With a Pull CDN, the very first time she does, the content isn't on the CDN. During the first request, CDN pulls the images and so forth to CDN server nearest your fan. The very first time CDN has to pull the post, meaning your server and reader won't see any gain in speed. The second time however (usually 1-30 days later) the CDN  has  the content loaded , and it will be available to everyone who is closest to the server. 


#### Push CDN 

Going along with the above example, instead of waiting around for the CDN to pull the content when it's needed, you simply upload the entire content of your travel blog to CDN before hand. That way your pictures, theme files, videos and rest are always on the CDN servers around the world. 

In simpler terms,

With a push CDN, you don't wait for users to request content. 

Instead, you(website owner )  upload your files directly to the CDN ahead of time. 

That means : 

*  You push your blog's images, videos, styles etc. into the CDN's server across the world before anyone asks for them. 
* So when the fan visits your blog, the files are already waiting at his/her nearest server . 
* He/She will get the content in the very first request.
