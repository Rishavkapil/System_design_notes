Elastic Search is a distributed search and analytical engine used for storing, searching and analyzing large volumes of data. 


At its core, you can think of elastic search as a server that can process JSON requests and give you back JSON data. 

Elastic search allows you to store, search and analyze huge volumes of data quickly  and in real time and give back answers in milliseconds. 

It is able to achieve fast search responses because instead of searching the text directly , it searches an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas and comes with intensive REST APIs for storing and searching the data. 


## How does elastic Search work ?

Elastic search organizes data into documents (in JSON), grouped into indices(like database). It uses an inverted index that maps words to document locations, for fast searches. 

Fundamentally, Elastic Search organizes data into documents, which are json based units of information representing entities. 

Documents are grouped into indecies , similar to database, based on their characterstics.
